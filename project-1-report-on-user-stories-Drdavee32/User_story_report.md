# Process:
   </p>So, what is a user story? are short, simple descriptions of a feature told 
from the </br> perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a 
user or customer of the system. <p\>

### HFSD Process:
 </p>  
    <b><u>3 Simple/Very Basic Steps!</br></b></u>
    <b><u>Step 1:</b></u> Gather idea's from your customer and understand what 
	they want. </br>
    <b><u>Step 2:</b></u> Need to add a title (so you can refer to it easier), 
	a rough description </br>(that contains details about how the development of that 
	task should be done),and a estimate.</br> You want to create user story's that 
	your customer will understand and not have to </br> ask question non-stop on what
	things do. Each and every user story should be handed off to </br>a single 
	developer of the project so, that each user story gets created and finished 
	on time. </br>
    <b><u>Step 3:</b></u> Now play planning poker with your group/team. </br>
    
   </p> What is <b>Planning Poker? </b>Planning Poker is an agile estimating and 
planning technique that is a</br>consensus based.<b> 
How it works:</b> Each Estimator/Team member is holding a deck of Planning 
Poker cards </br> with card values like 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40 and 100. 
These values represent the number of a story </br> points, ideal days in which
the team will estimate on how long they think it will take to complete </br>
each user story and the tasks that come with it.
   </p>

# **Reflection:**
   </p> <b>What I found that works:</b> is having prior knowledge or experience
with working with software because I feel like you know more of how long 
some parts of the software is actually going to take. At first I didnt think
Planning Poker would actually work. I have never heard of it and I was 
thinking "how are these cards going to respresent a real life planning 
process of developing software but, as we started playing, it seemed like
basic way to get an idea of how long it was going to take.
   </p><b> What I found difficult/that didn't work:</b> was trying to come up 
with a title thatboth the customer could understand and a description. When 
writing those from time to time they didn't work and they either had bad titles 
or not well short detailed descriptions and we had to scrap them or rewrite them.
   </p><b> Deviations from overall HFSD process:</b>I learn about planning 
poker. I didn't know that it even existed. I really didn't know how the process
really was for software development. I knew that there was a process I just 
didn't know the complete process and I think that HFSD explains it really well 
and its tone is nice and easy to understand and follow along and I think that is 
key when it comes to explaining things.
